# Contaminant-Modeling-of-Chloro-Ethenes-thorugh-an-unconfined-Aquifer
The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of a spill that occurred at ENS
industrial plant. Around 50 liters of solvent containing 15% Vinyl Chloride(VC), 25%
1,1-Dichloroethylene, 25% Tetrachloroethylene(PCE) and 35 % trichloroethylene(TCE) were
expelled.
To get well informed about the transport of contaminants, the aquifer characteristics were
examined, the 3-dimensions contaminant transport were simulated by the mass balance
equation, the plume result at different times of 1 month, 1 year and 5 years were estimated
using the Matlab Program,the concentration graph in vertical direction were obtained for
different times and the contaminants concentration were compared to the groundwater quality
standards set by The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection(NJDEP).
